# Porsche Car Classification Model

Welcome to my Porsche Car Classification project! In this project, I have created a classification model that can accurately classify different Porsche car models. I trained this model using machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning algorithms, to analyze and classify images of various Porsche car models.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to develop a model capable of accurately identifying different Porsche car models based on input images. The model has been trained on a large dataset of Porsche car images, which includes multiple variations of car models, angles, and lighting conditions. By learning from this diverse dataset, the model has become proficient in recognizing the distinctive features and characteristics of different Porsche car models.

## Model Deployment

I have deployed the Porsche car classification model on the web, making it accessible to anyone interested in identifying Porsche car models. You can access the deployed model using the following link: [Porsche Car Classification Model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jui-Chi/model).

## How to Use the Model

Using the deployed model is straightforward. Follow these steps to classify a Porsche car model:

1. Access the [Porsche Car Classification Model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jui-Chi/model) webpage.
2. Upload an image of a Porsche car that you want to classify.
3. Click the "Classify" button to initiate the classification process.
4. Wait for the model to process the image and provide the classification result.
5. The model will output the predicted Porsche car model based on the uploaded image.

## Model Performance and Limitations

The Porsche car classification model has been trained using state-of-the-art techniques and a large dataset, resulting in a high accuracy rate. However, it's important to note that the model might encounter challenges under certain conditions, such as poor image quality, unusual angles, or occluded car parts. While the model strives to provide accurate results, it's recommended to use high-quality images for optimal performance.

## Contributions and Feedback

I welcome contributions and feedback from the community to further enhance the Porsche car classification model. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or would like to collaborate on improving the model, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your interest in my Porsche Car Classification project! Enjoy exploring and classifying Porsche car models with the deployed model.
